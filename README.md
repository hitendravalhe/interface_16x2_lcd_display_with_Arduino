Displaying "Hello World" on a 16x2 LiquidCrystal Display using an Arduino board is a common project for beginners. To do this, the display needs to be connected to the board by using the following pinout:

RS pin is connected to pin 12 on the Arduino board
EN pin is connected to pin 11 on the Arduino board
D4 pin is connected to pin 5 on the Arduino board
D5 pin is connected to pin 4 on the Arduino board
D6 pin is connected to pin 3 on the Arduino board
D7 pin is connected to pin 2 on the Arduino board
After connecting the display, the next step is to write a program in the Arduino IDE that uses the LiquidCrystal library to control the display. This library provides functions for initializing the display, setting the cursor position, and printing text to the display.

This program first initializes the LiquidCrystal object with the pinout of the display. Then, in the setup() function, it initializes the display with the dimensions of the display (16x2) and prints "Hello World" to the display using the print() function.

When the program is uploaded to the Arduino board and executed, the display will show "Hello World" on the first line of the display. This can be modified to display other messages or to use the other functions provided by the LiquidCrystal library to control the display in other ways.
